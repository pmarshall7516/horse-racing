# Horse Racing Simulator

Welcome to the Horse Racing Simulator! Pick horses, watch them run!

## What you do
- Choose a race distance and pick your horse(s).
- Start the race and cheer them on.
- Run races again to see how results can change.

## How it works
- Each horse is a dice total from 2–12. Rolling two dice moves that horse forward.
- Common totals (like 6, 7, 8) are the “favorites.” They get rolled a lot, so they must earn more points to finish.
- Rare totals (like 2 or 12) are the “long shots.” They get rolled less, so they need fewer points to finish.
- Even favorites can lose because every roll is random—each race is a new set of dice throws.

## What you’ll see
- A track with moving horses so you can follow the race.
- A results board showing who won and by how much.
- A summary that reminds you which odds were favorites or long shots.


## Quick start
